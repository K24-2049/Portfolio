                        <p class="mem">One of my most impactful memories with a friend happened when I was going through a rough patch in life, feeling unsure about my future and my capabilities. This friend took me on a spontaneous trip one weekend, just to clear my head. We spent hours talking, laughing, and dreaming about what we wanted in life. They believed in me when I was struggling to believe in myself, reminding me of my strengths and showing me what true friendship is. That experience gave me a renewed sense of confidence, and it taught me the power of having someone who truly understands and supports you. It was a moment that reminded me of my potential, and since then, I’ve carried that lesson with me, knowing I can overcome challenges with the right mindset and support.</p>
